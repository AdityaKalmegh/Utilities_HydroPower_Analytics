Questions to be Addressed in the Presentation:

1 - How many NA errors are there in the dataset?
    Special notes:
        - For simplicity, and to answer the rest of the questions, fill all NA values with 0.
        - Amperes/amps, are a measure of electrical current. For consistency, and due the nature of sensor data, call a unit ‘offline’ if it has an hourly average total current less than 10A

2 - How many total hours was Unit C6 offline in 2018?

3 - How many hours was C6 offline in each month?

4 - What percentage of the time was C6 offline in each month?

5 - Which unit ran for the most amount of time in 2018?

6 - Which hour of the day has the most offline time?

7 - Create a graph showing the average cooling water temperature by month. Are there any other data points that have seasonality fluctuations?

8 - Are there any apparent differences between the cooling systems of the 5 units? Show the difference graphically. (I.e. Do any of the units run hotter?)

9 - For the month of May, design a dashboard for the cooling system that shows some graphs and relevant statistics (max, min, average, etc.) to display how the cooling system performed during the month.

10- What other type(s) of analysis or business intelligence reporting could be done to help understand the cooling systems and provide insights into their operational performance. What software tools and methods would you use?
