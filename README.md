EDA performed on the Hydro Power Generating Plant - Rocky Reach Dam FY18
It is a data set from a Hydro Generation Plant at the Rocky Reach Dam for the year 2018.
The data are hourly averages, and the associated timestamp is for the start of the hour (i.e. the
row labeled 3:00 am is for the hour from 3:00am – 4:00am). Each row includes two timestamps,
one in UTC Time and one in Pacific Time.

For Rocky Reach Small Units C2, C4, C5, C6, and C7, these are the measurements:
• avg_winding_temp(C) – average stator winding temperature in degrees Celsius
• total_current(A) – total generator electrical current in amperes
• avg_cooling_water_flow(gal/min) – average cooling water flow in gallons per minute
• avg_cooling_water_temp(C) – average cooling water temperature in degrees Celsius
• avg_cooling_air_out_temp(C) – average cooling air temperature as it leaves the cooler
and returns to the stator in degrees Celsius
