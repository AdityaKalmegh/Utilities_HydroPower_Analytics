1. Operational Health Monitoring
    Anomaly Detection Reports:
        * Identify unusual spikes/drops in temperature, flow, or current (e.g., Z-score or ML-based outlier detection).
        * Flag recurring or long-duration offline periods.

    Compressor Efficiency Index**:
        * Calculate metrics like *energy per unit cooling delivered*.
        * Compare performance across units normalized by load.

2. Trend and Usage Analysis
    Time-Series Dashboards:

        * Hourly/daily/weekly trends of key metrics (temp, flow, current).
        * Seasonal performance shifts — is summer stress observable?

    Unit Utilization Report:

        * % uptime vs downtime per unit per week/month.
        * Heatmaps for visualizing runtime and idle time.

3. Predictive Maintenance & Reliability**

    Maintenance Alert System**:
        * Predictive modeling using degradation patterns (e.g., rising temperature + declining flow = clogged heat exchanger).
    Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**:
        * Track failure frequency per unit and calculate MTBF to prioritize inspections.


4. Performance Benchmarking**

    Cross-Unit Comparison**:

        * Rank compressors by energy efficiency, runtime, and stability.
        * Identify underperforming units and drill into reasons (e.g., older equipment, sensor drift).

    Cooling Load vs Ambient Conditions**:

        * Correlate external air temp (if available) with system performance.
        * Are cooling systems operating harder during hotter hours?

5. Cost & Energy Optimization**

    Energy Consumption Modeling**:

        * Estimate power usage based on total current (A) per unit × runtime.
        * Use this to calculate \$ cost of cooling per unit.

    Optimization Scenarios**:

        * Simulate cost savings from scheduling unit rotations or maintenance shutdowns.
        * Load balancing across units to reduce wear-and-tear on any single compressor.

6. Failure Investigation Reports**

    Post-Event Root Cause Analysis**:

        * Automatically generate a report when a unit goes offline.
        * Show metrics before, during, and after the event.
